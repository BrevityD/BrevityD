## Hi there, I'm Brevity_D 👋

I’m BrevityD (you can also call me Alexander😀), a Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), graduating in July 2026. 

My research focuses on the post training of LLMs (a.k.a. Large Language Models); KRR (a.k.a. Knowledge Representation & Reasoning); and exploring LLM Agents.

### Coding & Collaboration

Proficient in Python | Once a Microcontroller with C

Solid experience with Git workflows (mostly in private repos and self-hosted Gitea) 

Currently building a rule-based reasoning + LLM verifier (to pair with reward models) – code will open once the paper was submited! 📄➡️🔓

My projects are budding — your stars help them bloom! 🌟(*-对不起我太菜了都没有什么star路过的好心人给点给点-*)

### Beyond Code
📚 Bookworm with a soft spot for Romanticism, medieval European history, and philosophy. My current motto: "Do not negate the unconsoled loyalty"*-不要消解那无慰藉的忠诚-*(Thoughts after reading some Camus’ works). 

🚴♂️ Casual cyclist – my legs protest beyond 100km/day, but the breeze keeps me hooked!

### Let’s Connect!
